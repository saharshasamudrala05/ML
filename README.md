# Iâ€™m thrilled to share this Online Payment Fraud Detection using Machine Learning. By harnessing the power of Python and advanced machine learning algorithms, I developed a robust model to accurately detect fraudulent transactions. This project involved meticulous data preprocessing, feature engineering, and the application of algorithms like Logistic Regression and Random Forest. The result was a highly accurate model that significantly improves the security of online payments. This experience has greatly enhanced my skills in data analysis and machine learning, and I'm excited to apply these techniques to future challenges.
